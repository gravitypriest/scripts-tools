Miscellaneous scripts and tools used around the house

#####subtitle-timing-conflict.py
Check simple timing collisions in .ASS subtitle files -- if a line begins before the previous line is finished.

#####zero-bd-chapters.py
Zeroes out the first line of a Blu-ray formatted (HH:MM:SS.sss) chapter file, and adjusts the rest accordingly.  Useful if the source playlist references multiple sequential .m2ts files and you want to create a chapter list for each video.
